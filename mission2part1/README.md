# hadassim

In order to activate the server-side project, follow the following instructions:

1. Install a work environment (for example VScode).
2. Install Git.
3. Install node.
4. Clone to repository: https://github.com/elishevadales/hadassim.git 
5. Do "npm install" in terminal ("node_modules" folder will show up).
6. Install postman. The POST requests are made through it.

Of course, I didn't upload the password file to GitHub, so you won't be able to run the program.
That's why I uploaded my project to an external server in order for you to have access to the project:
